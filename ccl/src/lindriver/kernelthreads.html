<H1>Linux Kernel Threads in Device Drivers</H1>

<H2>Purpose</H2>
This examples shows how to create and stop a kernel 
thread.<BR>
The driver is implemented as a loadable module. In the init_module() 
routine five kernel threads are created. This kernel threads sleep one second, wake 
up, print a message and fall asleep again. On unload of the module 
(cleanup_module), the kernel threads are killed.<BR>
The example has been tested 
with Linux kernel 2.4.2 on Intel (uni processor only) and Alpha 
platform (COMPAQ Personal Workstation 500au (uni processor), DS20 and ES40 (SMP).<p>
A version for the 2.2 kernel can be found <a href="old_example.tar.gz">here</a>.
Note: depending on the context of the creator of the threads the new threads
may inherit properties from the parent you do not want to have. The new version
avoids this by having <code>keventd</code> create the threads. The 2.2. kernel
do not have a <code>keventd</code>, so this approach is not implementable there.

<H2>Functions in example</H2>
<UL>
  <LI><code>start_kthread</code>: creates a new kernel thread. Can be called from any
  process context but not from interrupt. The functions blocks until
  the thread started.</li>
  <LI><code>stop_kthread</code>: stop the thread. Can be called from any process context
  but the thread to be terminated. Cannot be called from interrupt context.
  The function blocks until the thread terminated.</li>
  <LI><code>init_kthread</code>: sets the environment of the new threads. Is to be called out 
  of the created thread. </li>
  <LI><code>exit_kthread</code>: needs to be called by the thread to be terminated on exit </LI>
</UL>

<H2>Creation of new Thread</H2>
A new thread is created with <code>kernel_thread()</code>. The thread inherits properties
from its parents. To make sure that we do not get any weired properties,
we let <code>keventd</code> create the new thread.<BR>
The new thread is created with <code>start_kthread()</code>. It uses a semaphore 
to block until the new thread is running. A <code>down()</code> blocks the
<code>start_kthread()</code>
routine until the corresponding <code>up()</code> call in <code>init_kthread()</code>
 is executed. <br>
The new thread must call <code>init_kthread()</code> in order to let the
creator continue.

<H2>Stop of new Thread</H2>
<code>stop_kthread()</code> sets a flag that the thread uses to 
determine whether do die or not and sends a SIGKILL to the thread. This signal 
causes the thread to be woken up. On wakeup it will check for the flag and then 
terminate itself by calling <code>exit_kthread</code> and returning from the thread function.
With a semaphore the <code>stop_kthread()</code> function blocks until the 
thread terminated. 

<H2>Initialization of new Thread</H2>
Within the new created thread, <code>init_kthread()</code> needs 
to be called. This function sets a signal mask, initialises a wait queue, the 
termination flag and sets a new name for the thread.
With a <code>up()</code> call it notifies the creator that the setup is 
done. 

<H2>Exit of new Thread</H2>
When the thread receives the notification to 
terminate itself, is calls the <code>exit_kthread()</code> function.
It notifies the 
<code>stop_kthread()</code> function that it terminated with an <code>up()</code> call. 

<H2>The new Thread itself</H2>
The new thread is implemented in the 
<code>example_thread()</code> function. It runs an endless loop (<code>for(;;)</code>).
 In the loop it 
falls asleep with the <code>interruptible_sleep_on_timeout()</code> function. It comes out of 
this function either when the timeout expires or when a signal got 
caught.<BR>
The "work" in the thread is to print out a message with printk. 

<h2>Kernel Versions</h2>
The example has been tested on 2.4.2.
